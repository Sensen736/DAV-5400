    "## Introduction\n",
    "* We all know that 'Money can't buy you happiness' but we also believe happiness score changes when economics changeing, which could reflect on alcohol consumption. In our research, we are going to dive into alcohol consumption and economics in different area. Beyond that, we covers the price point and quality of wine as wellï¼› certain features of better rated wine at different price point, so our targeted audience can get more information of alcohol business.\n"

    "* Results of our research questions might be used for a alcohol company or individual liquor stores, providing them a better view of the alcohol business, including price aspect and category aspect. Our research can provide them more information about how to positioning their product,individual store or liquor company depending on the local economics. "

    "* Since we have two types of datasets (CSV and JSON) and both datasets have a huge amount of data, we decided to only use related data for our research. We will use python pandas to read these datasets and do the cleaning up and transformation and combine these two datasets into one dataset and stored in our online Github as CSV format.\n",
    "* To analyze our data, we would apply a box plot and a histogram for each of the alcohol type from the alcohol consumption dataset, and do a bar chart of alcohol category for each of the few countries with the highest wine consumption; then select those countries from the wine review dataset, and draw a scatter plot to show the relationship between price and review points.

    "* For a feature we have not covered this semester, we would like to generate an ANOVA test for happiness score, review points, and price. Our purpose is to find out the relationship of these variables when we have happiness score as a dependent variable, and review points and price as independent variables. "
